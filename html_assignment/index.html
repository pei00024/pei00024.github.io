        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Junyi PEI, you can just call me Mello. Chinese names can be tricky to pronounce because the pronunciation rules differ from English, so feel free to call me Mello<sup>1</sup> that my friends all do. If you’d like to learn the pronunciation of my name, it’s “péijyùnyi<sup>2</sup>”.</p>
        <p>I arrived in Ottawa this February, right on the Chinese New Year<sup>3</sup>. My flight was actually on the day of the festival, so I missed celebrating it fully before I left China. It’s a small regret, but starting my new life here has made me very happy.</p>
